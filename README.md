Launchkey Mini MK2 for Bitwig Studio
===

I've tried to implement exactly same features as for Ableton Live.

There are only two additional features:
1. Upper start button works as 'play', and lower as 'stop' when not in InControl mode.
2. Hold upper start button in InControl to see and change selected parameters page (upper line) and drumpad bank page (lower line)
